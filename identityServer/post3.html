    <h1>Hitting our custom IdentityServer endpoint from your SPA</h1>
    <p>In this post I will discuss how to make your Xamarin app authenticate against our IdentityServer. Whether you&quot;re
        using a typical IdentityServer install or the custom one discussed in another post, the setup should be similar The
        advantage of using IdentityServer for auth is that you retain all the benefits of provided by it like JWT generation,
        scopes, etc.</p>
    <p>First you will need to pull a nuget package into your shared project called IdentityModel. I had a problem installing
        it directly into my PCL project due to profile mismatches so I actually downloaded it into my iOS project then referenced
        that in my PCL project.</p>
    <div><img src="IdentityModel.png" /></div>
    <p>Now you will want to hit the IdentityServer discovery endpoint. This call will tell you where the auth endpoint and other
        endpoints are. I used the following code to do this:</p>
    <pre>
        var disco = await DiscoveryClient.GetAsync(ApiBaseUrl);
    </pre>
    <p>Then you can actually hit the endpoint for to authenticate. THIS </p>
    <pre>
        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(disco?.TokenEndpoint))
        {
            var tokenClient = new TokenClient(disco.TokenEndpoint, "ClientId", "SecretFromConfig");
            var tokenResponse = await tokenClient.RequestResourceOwnerPasswordAsync(
                authRequestModel.Username,
                authRequestModel.Password,
                "Api",
                new
                {
                    PhoneIdentifier = authRequestModel.PhoneIdentifier,
                    PhoneIdentifierType = authRequestModel.PhoneIdentifierType
                });

            if (!tokenResponse.IsError)
            {
                // YAY SUCCESS, do successful stuff
            }
            else 
            {
                // handle errors
            } 
        }
    </pre>
    <p>As you can see, the first thing I do is make sure the authentcation endoint came back correctly. Then we move onto bulding
        the client. The first arguement is the url for authentication endpoint; pretty self explinatory. The next two arguments
        are based on your IdentityServer4 configuration. It should be the state which client you are and the secret associated
        with that client.</p>
    <p>Once you setup the client its time to get r done. When sending your request to RequestResourceOwnerPasswordAsync for
        the first two arguements you will put the username and password of the user. Next comes the scope you&quot;re requesting
        access to, in this case the Api. Last, and optionally, you pass any additional parameters that you will need in your
        custom authentication method. That's pretty much it. You can do what you would like after the success authentication!</p>
